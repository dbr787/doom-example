# TODO

- Make sure it works on mac, and locally
- Check env vars, only include or use required
- Always have a game mode input available, so user can change at any time
- Make doom run immediately, always polling, use above input step to direct game start and mode
- Create an options that uses dynamic pipelines, and one that just does it from the long-running job, this would have to consider command steps or just input steps
- Can the annotation table with steps be a scrollable section? Or have older moves a collapsable section?
- If no input for 10 minutes, kill job (inside doom.rb)
- Make the doom game quit frame when build is cancelled, or make the guy die
